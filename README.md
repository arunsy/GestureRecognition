## General Information
- Solve the feature which is developed in smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by user without using remote.
- The gestures are
    - Increase the volume (Thumbs up
    - Decrease the volume (Thumbs down)
    - Jump backwards 10 seconds (Left swipe)
    - Jump forward 10 seconds (Right swipe)
    - Pause the movie (Stop).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- When we use RNN of LSTM Neural Network with Convolution 2D, we get better training and validation predication results.
